All qualifying members will be allowed to overdraw their account up to $20 on debit card purchases and cash withdrawals initially, but may be later eligible for a higher limit of up to $200 or more based on member&#39;s Chime Account history, direct deposit frequency and amount, spending activity and other risk-based factors. Your limit will be displayed to you within the Chime mobile app. You will receive notice of any changes to your limit. Your limit may change at any time, at Chime&#39;s discretion. Although there are no overdraft fees, there may be out-of-network or third party fees associated with ATM transactions. SpotMe won&#39;t cover non-debit card transactions, including ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, or Chime Checkbook transactions.

This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.<br><br>Enroll in our beta program!

With DuckDuckGo, privacy can be your default.<br><br><b>Search Privately</b> — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in so you can search the web without being tracked. <br><br><b>Block Tracking Cookies</b> — prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.<br><br><b>Escape Website Trackers Before They Load</b> —We automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using any personal data from these trackers.  Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default. <br><br><b>Automatically Enforce Encryption</b> — Smarter Encryption forces many sites you visit in DuckDuckGo to use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes. <br><br><b>Block Email Trackers (Beta)</b> — 70% of emails track you as soon as you open them. Enabling Email Protection is the easy way to block most email trackers and hide your address without switching services. <br><br><b>Protect Your Privacy in Other Apps (Beta)</b> — Block most hidden app trackers in other apps day or night and prevent third-party companies from invading your privacy with App Tracking Protection.

Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.  <br><br>Read more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections/ <br><br>You don&#39;t need to wait to take back your privacy.

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.\",\n            \"scoreText\": \"4.7\",\n            \"score\": 4.741363,\n            \"playstoreUrl\": \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn\",\n            \"permissions\": \"http://gplayapi.srik.me/api/apps/com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn/permissions\",\n            \"similar\": \"http://gplayapi.srik.me/api/apps/com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn/similar\",\n            \"reviews\": \"http://gplayapi.srik.me/api/apps/com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn/reviews\",\n            \"datasafety\": \"http://gplayapi.srik.me/api/apps/com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn/datasafety\",\n            \"categories\": \"http://gplayapi.srik.me/api/categories/\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Adobe Acrobat Reader: Edit PDF\",\n            \"appId\": \"com.adobe.reader\",\n            \"url\": \"http://gplayapi.srik.me/api/apps/com.adobe.reader\",\n            \"icon\": \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BkRfMfIRPR9hUnmIYGDgHHKjow-g18-ouP6B2ko__VnyUHSi1spcc78UtZ4sVUtBH4g\",\n            \"developer\": {\n                \"devId\": \"Adobe\",\n                \"url\": \"http://gplayapi.srik.me/api/developers/Adobe\"\n            },\n            \"currency\": \"USD\",\n            \"price\": 0,\n            \"free\": true,\n            \"summary\": \"Do you need to work with documents on the go?

Download Firefox now.<br><br>When you use Firefox, you’re helping support Mozilla, which is backed by a non-profit foundation whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. We know there are a lot of choices out there, some of them produced by huge tech companies, but in choosing Firefox you’re joining a unique community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  <br><br>Firefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. <br>Recently, a lot of internet browsers started talking about their new and improved privacy features, and we think that’s great. But for us, privacy isn’t the latest buzzword in the browser business. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than you do about profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.<br><br><b>STREAMLINED HOME SCREEN</b><br>Pick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.<br><br><b>FAST. PRIVATE. SAFE.</b><br>Keep what’s personal private without sacrificing speed. With Firefox, you can have more control to decide what to share online and when. We designed Firefox with smart browsing features that let you take your privacy, password and bookmarks with you wherever you go.<br><br><b>MAKE FIREFOX YOUR OWN</b><br>Make Firefox your go-to, get-it-done, default browser. And with Firefox widgets, you can jump right to searching the web or using private-browsing mode straight from your phone’s home screen.<br><br><b>PRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES</b><br>Firefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, crypto-miners and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to “strict” blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.<br><br><b>SEAMLESS BROWSING ACROSS DEVICES</b><br>Add Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. Sync your devices and send open tabs between mobile and desktop. Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.<br><br><b>FIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR</b><br>Get search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.<br><br><b>GET ADD-ONS</b><br>Full support for the most popular add-ons, including ways to turbo-charge powerful default privacy settings and customize your experience.<br><br><b>ORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE</b><br>Create as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.<br><br><b>SHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS</b><br>Firefox makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.<br><br><b>LEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:</b><br>- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions<br>- Stay in the know: https://blog.mozilla.org<br><br><b>ABOUT MOZILLA</b><br>Mozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled.

But does have one very annoying flaw, which is how incredibly easy it is to accidentally delete offline pages. There have been several occasions where I attempted to tap on an article, but ever so slightly, swiped a little to the side at the same time, which deletes the page. It dosen't ask for confirmation, but rather just removes the page in a blink of an eye.

This app and wikipedia in general are one of the silver linings of the attrocious noise the internet and apps have become.\",\n        \"I truly love the wikipedia app, but suddenly the crowned feature, the Places tab, is missing from my version.

I can't for the life of me figure out why it'd be removed. A light has been lost in my life, hence the dim star rating. With it, it'd be 5 stars. Without it, only suffering.\",\n        \"The newest version (as of May 2019) is practically unusable. Highly frequent crashing, particularly when trying to save an article to the reading list.

I think I use Google maps more than any other app on my phone. However, I've also recently experienced a lot of really terrible bugs as described in the previous two reviews. I think it is limited to the driving mode, but when that is enabled it freezes pretty regularly to the point where I've had to restart my phone while driving in order to get the navigation to reload.

Such examples can consist of customizing the height of the keyboard between 7 different heights. Don't like the number row? No problem, get rid of it!

The absolute best!\",\n                \"This is my favorite keyboard to use on my phone. I love all the different ways you can personalize the keyboard to my specific style.

The other feature I cannot live without is the option to switch to voice typing with a simple click on the microphone icon conviently located in the upper right hand corner of the keyboard at all times. 100/100 Gboard!\",\n                \"Opacity setting would be 🌚nice💸 but I can't find that option because it's buried in a submenu somewhere.

Have an older tablet where Samsung is not upgrading the OS past version 5.1.1. This version won't see the entire SD card as internal storage. This issue is not exclusive to Google Play Games. It's just a pain when the tablet's internal storage can't be upgraded beyond 32 GB and it's running out of space. Am doing everything possible to disable unused Samsung apps, move all data files to the SD card, and much as other apps as they allow to the SD card.

I've had this issue access to devices and seeing the other reviewers, I'm not alone in the problem. Something as simple as a 20 minute timer won't go off reliably. There aren't any \\\"missed alarm\\\" notifications for when the alarms don't ring. Nothing but disappointment. This still has not been fixed 6 mos later\",\n                \"For whatever reason the newest update made some BAD changes. I no longer have an easy access when the alarm goes off.

You always know when it's about to happen, because the app starts to become jittery. By that point, it's too late to avoid. There's the screen rotation bug, where it just suddenly stops working automatically. There's the off-screen fullscreen bug. Just, unstable, for an entire year.\",\n                \"Okay, so this app is extremely useful and fun to use, however, it is slowly crumblint over time, specifically as it applies to usage of ads. It has now been updated to force you to watch the two ads at the beginning or even in the middle of videos in order to proceed, and yes you can skip them, but there are some 10-15 second ads that cant be skipped, which means, whilst im attempting to enjoy a video, i have to have upwards of 30 seconds of my time wasted, good app, poor decision making.\",\n                \"Youtube has been running good till i recently updated it. My video would constantly stop and the audio and time would continue playing. I would often find myself skipping backwards in the video just to see if it'll keep going and its an annoying process. I just want to enjoy my videos without having to check on if its playing right. I wouldnt mind it as much if i was listening to music or a podcast, but I really dont do that often. I'm leaving this review in hopes that it gets fixed soon\",\n                \"Completely Miserable To Use. Simply scrolling autoplays everything even remotely visible on screen. Worse of all is that the last second or so of every single video is cut off, when I know for a fact that the videos are longer. It ruins so many videos, especially short ones. I've sat through 30 seconds of ads just for a 3 second video, only for it to cut off the last second. Google really wet the bed in excitement as it clammered for more piles of Ad money, at the expense of the userbase. Awful.\",\n                \"No longer rotates in landscape without unlocking rotation lock. As of v17.33.42 (8/24/22), YouTube stopped allowing landscape videos to rotate if you want the bottom of the screen to be the side other than the one YT chooses. I prefer the top of my device to be the left side when I watch videos b/c it puts the volume controls on the top. I also prefer to leave rotation lock on for my phone since I don't use any other apps in landscape modes.

There's nothing fancy about Slides; it's just a simple, clean app with all the features you need and everything right where you'd expect it. I appreciate the Google Drive cloud integration too. Being able to access my work from any phone or computer in the world is awesome. Oddly enough; I mostly use Slides as a photo editor for social media. It's surprisingly good at that; lots of customization options.\",\n                \"I was using this for a project and all the things I was using on the computer for it are not available.

Highlighting is out of the question. Good for presenting but not much else.\",\n                \"Always my go to for making a presentation for school and work.

I've tried freeing up space and everything I could think of but it hasn't worked the same. If I can't listen to my audiobooks I would at least want my money back. UPDATE: Used the troubleshooting methods and it still isnt working. Its really inconvenient to not be able to listen to my audio books when I already paid for them\",\n                \"So glad this exists. Can't even remember if I downloaded it or if it came with my new phone. But it allowed me to delete an old player that I kept simply because it was the only that did a very specific thing. This does everything I want it to and it does it well. My only issue is at some point the voice speed changed. Only two settings that affect the speed now, each is either too fast or too slow in my opinion. Add a speak speed setting and it's perfect.\",\n                \"This app is useful, but it could easily be a lot better. What I love is that it saves my notes and highlights to Drive and syncs them across devices. Some things I hate about this app: (1) You can't adjust play speed in the app. (2) No pause, play, or skip buttons on the main screen. You have to use the pull-down menu. (3) You can't highlight something that starts and ends on separate pages. You have to make two separate highlights.

It also picks up where I left off and doesn't start automatically when it connects to my car, (which drives me nuts). Solid app.\",\n                \"What a superb way to listen to all your favourite shows and podcasts. Perfect for on the go, relaxing, in the car, or to help you drift off to sleep. The Google Podcasts app is easy to use, and the download function enables listening to podcasts even when offline, for later listening whilst in remote areas with no wifi or cell phone signal. I love everything about this app and the great range of podcast stations that are available.

I love the layout and the many options to adjust your images exactly how you want them! The best feature by far is the ability to undo, tweak, or even completely change. It is very easy to customize and make your work as best as possible. I love Snapseed!\",\n                \"Overall this has seemed to be the best alternative to photoshop I've been able to find.

The \\\"Brush\\\" tool would be even better with a size meter/option to control, along with some of the options under \\\"Tune\\\" to be available in the \\\"Brush\\\" tool in order to get them more precise. Maybe an undo button instead of eraser. And some sort of overall tool for smoothing/dehazing/color noise as well.\",\n                \"Great app! Bit of a learning curve so -1☆, but nothing too complicated, and there are tutorials I haven't dug into yet. Love that there are ZERO ads! That's awesome, thank you! Tons of tools! What I really love that other apps don't have, is the ability to go back into each edit and do some major fine tuning or artistic touches, save them as filters, and batch edit a whole collection! A favorite tool is \\\"Expand\\\" I have tried countless apps, and this is the only one with the feature,so TY!\",\n                \"One of the best picture editing apps. 🔥 🔥 🔥 However, please bring back the previous smart/black/white expansion function - it used to be able to expand in only ONE SELECTED DIRECTION (or two) and now expands towards all sides equally which makes editing quite cumbersome later as cropping the unneeded areas isn't very easy to do on a small screen accurately. It used to be so good for framing the picture (black/white expansion) or adding missing areas with the smart expansion tool.\",\n                \"Its ok with very basic editing features. Unfortunately most are unusable aside from the healing brush. Things like dodge and burn should have the ability to adjust intensity on a sliding scale. A standard paintbrush would also be nice if ability to tap an area to adjust color were present. There should also be a selective erase feature for all filters as well as ability to adjust intensity.

Before the latest update, it was a bit more aesthetic and did not obstruct the screen as much when you brought up the seek bar since it was semi-transparent. However, when you bring up the seek bar now, it has this terrible opaque black backing that obstructs about two fifths (2/5) of the video. ---- My theory is that this was done for performance reasons as I notice when you pause, there's no more animation for the pause like there was before (though the symbols are misaligned when you pause). I can understand not doing animations for the sake of speeding the app up, but why remove the transparency? When a user brings up the seek bar, it is not like they're totally disinterested in the video. Being able to see bits of the video underneath is helpful.\",\n                \"We're being forced to use this app for music playing. What a joke. There are no features in this app for playing music that work with the way most people play music. Music and Youtube videos are entirely different things. I don't want a liked song to be replaced by a 10 year old music video that has awful audio. I also don't want a video I liked that featured audio to be part of my music collection. Do people who listen to music actually work on this app? Google is really going downhill with these latest changes. And of course, being google, in a year or two they'll go a completely different direction because they can't get their act together. I'm guessing in 2021 they'll introduce Google Hangouts Music and the only way we can listen to music is if our friends like it too.\",\n                \"When I bought my TV, everything worked great.

I have to go the the app in settings and close it, then reopen it. It also flashes a black screen periodically for a fraction of a second.

The Bad: Plays maybe 30 seconds of any video on other TVs running Android 6 then locks up. Sometimes you can get it to work if you restart, but it's inconsistent. Going into the app and removing all updates back to factory delivered version of the app and it works just fine, well until it gets re-updated. This is true on multiple devices from multiple manufactures using multiple different processors.   Very frustrating that Google can't get it together to run their own app on their own platform. It's really pretty inexcusable, especially since Amazon can manage to deliver a more consistent YouTube experience on a FireTV using Silk (or Firefox for that matter) than Google can with their own app on their own platform. Trying to reproduce the same scenario using Chrome on AndroidTV gets you an unnavigatable mess.What ever was done in some update somewhere made this a useless app on many devices.

Just make it it's own Card. Settings > Clock Face > Media Controller > Notifications. I should be able to swipe up and down and get back to it easily. Maybe give an option to make it the default card if media is playing?  3) Battery life still leaves a lot to be desired.  4) Performance still needs a lot of work.\",\n                \"Works great but it could be more useful to add a feature that the clock notifies when the Bluetooth is out-of-range just like some wireless headsets do.
