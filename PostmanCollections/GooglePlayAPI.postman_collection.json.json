When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app.\\u202fThe one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.<br><br>Getting started with passwordless<br><br>Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.<br><br>Getting started with autofill<br><br>Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.<br><br>Microsoft personal, work or school accounts<br><br>Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.<br><br>Enroll in our beta program!

With one download you get a new everyday browser that offers seamless protections from most third-party trackers while you search and browse, and access to tracking protection when receiving email and using other apps on your device. With DuckDuckGo, privacy can be your default.<br><br><b>Search Privately</b> — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in so you can search the web without being tracked. <br><br><b>Block Tracking Cookies</b> — prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.<br><br><b>Escape Website Trackers Before They Load</b> —We automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using any personal data from these trackers.  Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default. <br><br><b>Automatically Enforce Encryption</b> — Smarter Encryption forces many sites you visit in DuckDuckGo to use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes. <br><br><b>Block Email Trackers (Beta)</b> — 70% of emails track you as soon as you open them. Enabling Email Protection is the easy way to block most email trackers and hide your address without switching services. <br><br><b>Protect Your Privacy in Other Apps (Beta)</b> — Block most hidden app trackers in other apps day or night and prevent third-party companies from invading your privacy with App Tracking Protection. See notes and links below for more information. Join the private waitlist for the free beta version through the app settings menu.<br><br>The DuckDuckGo app has the browsing features you expect, like tabs and bookmarks, plus privacy controls you’ll love. Taking control of your privacy doesn&#39;t have to mean making tradeoffs. <br><br><b>Tap Fire Button, Burn Data</b> — Clear your tabs and browsing data with one tap of the Fire Button. <br><br><b>Signal Your Privacy Preference with GPC</b> — Built into the app, Global Privacy Control (GPC) intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.<br><br>Note about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks:  <br>Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts.

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.\",\n            \"scoreText\": \"4.7\",\n            \"score\": 4.741363,\n            \"playstoreUrl\": \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn\",\n            \"permissions\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn/permissions\",\n            \"similar\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn/similar\",\n            \"reviews\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn/reviews\",\n            \"datasafety\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.fast.free.unblock.secure.vpn/datasafety\",\n            \"categories\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/categories/\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Adobe Acrobat Reader: Edit PDF\",\n            \"appId\": \"com.adobe.reader\",\n            \"url\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.adobe.reader\",\n            \"icon\": \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BkRfMfIRPR9hUnmIYGDgHHKjow-g18-ouP6B2ko__VnyUHSi1spcc78UtZ4sVUtBH4g\",\n            \"developer\": {\n                \"devId\": \"Adobe\",\n                \"url\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/developers/Adobe\"\n            },\n            \"currency\": \"USD\",\n            \"price\": 0,\n            \"free\": true,\n            \"summary\": \"Do you need to work with documents on the go?

Download Firefox now.<br><br>When you use Firefox, you’re helping support Mozilla, which is backed by a non-profit foundation whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. We know there are a lot of choices out there, some of them produced by huge tech companies, but in choosing Firefox you’re joining a unique community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  <br><br>Firefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. <br>Recently, a lot of internet browsers started talking about their new and improved privacy features, and we think that’s great. But for us, privacy isn’t the latest buzzword in the browser business. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than you do about profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.<br><br><b>STREAMLINED HOME SCREEN</b><br>Pick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.<br><br><b>FAST. PRIVATE. SAFE.</b><br>Keep what’s personal private without sacrificing speed. With Firefox, you can have more control to decide what to share online and when. We designed Firefox with smart browsing features that let you take your privacy, password and bookmarks with you wherever you go.<br><br><b>MAKE FIREFOX YOUR OWN</b><br>Make Firefox your go-to, get-it-done, default browser. And with Firefox widgets, you can jump right to searching the web or using private-browsing mode straight from your phone’s home screen.<br><br><b>PRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES</b><br>Firefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, crypto-miners and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to “strict” blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.<br><br><b>SEAMLESS BROWSING ACROSS DEVICES</b><br>Add Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. Sync your devices and send open tabs between mobile and desktop. Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.<br><br><b>FIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR</b><br>Get search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.<br><br><b>GET ADD-ONS</b><br>Full support for the most popular add-ons, including ways to turbo-charge powerful default privacy settings and customize your experience.<br><br><b>ORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE</b><br>Create as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.<br><br><b>SHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS</b><br>Firefox makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.<br><br><b>LEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:</b><br>- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions<br>- Stay in the know: https://blog.mozilla.org<br><br><b>ABOUT MOZILLA</b><br>Mozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled.

Help your child make healthy decisions about what they do on their Android device, with activity reports showing how much time they’re spending on their favorite apps. You can see daily, weekly, or monthly reports.<br>  • Manage their apps - Handy notifications let you approve or block apps your child wants to download from the Google Play Store. You can also manage in-app purchases, and hide specific apps on their device, all remotely from your own device.<br>  • Feed their curiosity - It can be hard to figure out what apps are right for your child, so Family Link shows you teacher-recommended apps on Android that you can add directly to their device.<br><br><br>  <b>Keep an eye on screen time</b><br><br>  • Set limits - It’s up to you to decide the right amount of screen time for your child. Family Link lets you set time limits and a bedtime for their supervised devices, so you can help them find a good balance.<br>  • Lock their device - Whether it’s time to go play outside, have dinner, or just spend time together, you can remotely lock a supervised device whenever it’s time to take a break.<br><br><br>  <b>See where they are</b><br><br>  • It’s helpful to be able to find your child when they’re on the go.

See a list of compatible devices at families.google.com/familylink/setup<br>  • While Family Link helps you manage your child&#39;s purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.<br>  • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps.<br>  • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, it must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet.<br>  • Teacher-recommended apps are only available on Android devices in the US to parents of children of certain ages.<br>  • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience, it does not make the internet safe.

Word to developers: the text runs *right up* to the right-side border and has some left-right movement. I'm constantly sliding the app's pages to the left so that I can read the end of the sentence. It's not looking like it was well-crafted. And the new tabbing: yuk. Somewhat poor in terms of usability. I've seen you guys do better. I know you can. I'm a donor, so maybe give a listen.\",\n        \"Offline usage, SD storage and great interface. But does have one very annoying flaw, which is how incredibly easy it is to accidentally delete offline pages. There have been several occasions where I attempted to tap on an article, but ever so slightly, swiped a little to the side at the same time, which deletes the page. It dosen't ask for confirmation, but rather just removes the page in a blink of an eye. Although it does allow you to undo this, the page will have to be downloaded again.\",\n        \"This is such a great, well made app. It's probably my favorite app on my phone right now. You can create reading lists of different subjects and they are available offline. Furthermore, when reading an article and clicking on a highlighted word it gives a summary overlay popup that doesn't pull you away from the current article, however you can go to the full article if you desire to. This app and wikipedia in general are one of the silver linings of the attrocious noise the internet and apps have become.\",\n        \"I truly love the wikipedia app, but suddenly the crowned feature, the Places tab, is missing from my version. This feature placed nearby articles on an interactive map. It helped me navigate new cities, and turned the world into a museum. I loved it. It's necessary. I can't for the life of me figure out why it'd be removed. A light has been lost in my life, hence the dim star rating. With it, it'd be 5 stars. Without it, only suffering.\",\n        \"The newest version (as of May 2019) is practically unusable. Highly frequent crashing, particularly when trying to save an article to the reading list. This forces the app to restart and I end up losing what I was reading. This is VERY annoying, especially considering I hadn't experienced this issue on older versions. Please fix this! The app is otherwise fantastic, but this one issue ruins the whole experience for me.\"\n    ],\n    \"appId\": \"org.wikipedia\",\n    \"url\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/org.wikipedia\",\n    \"playstoreUrl\": \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us\",\n    \"permissions\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/org.wikipedia/permissions\",\n    \"similar\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/org.wikipedia/similar\",\n    \"datasafety\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/org.wikipedia/datasafety\",\n    \"categories\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/categories/\"\n}"

I think I use Google maps more than any other app on my phone. However, I've also recently experienced a lot of really terrible bugs as described in the previous two reviews.

Android typing experience. You seriously can't get much better than this. Plenty of customizable options for those who like their experience a specific way (Which I totally get as I am one of those people). Such examples can consist of customizing the height of the keyboard between 7 different heights. Don't like the number row? No problem, get rid of it! Want to spice up your keyboard with different colors? Do it! This is a perfect keyboard. 100% recommend to everyone! The absolute best!\",\n                \"This is my favorite keyboard to use on my phone. I love all the different ways you can personalize the keyboard to my specific style.

The other feature I cannot live without is the option to switch to voice typing with a simple click on the microphone icon conviently located in the upper right hand corner of the keyboard at all times. 100/100 Gboard!\",\n                \"Opacity setting would be 🌚nice💸 but I can't find that option because it's buried in a submenu somewhere.

Have an older tablet where Samsung is not upgrading the OS past version 5.1.1. This version won't see the entire SD card as internal storage. This issue is not exclusive to Google Play Games. It's just a pain when the tablet's internal storage can't be upgraded beyond 32 GB and it's running out of space. Am doing everything possible to disable unused Samsung apps, move all data files to the SD card, and much as other apps as they allow to the SD card. So every app that doesn't allow this is a problem when trying to squeeze more life out of a 4.5 year old tablet.\"\n            ],\n            \"appId\": \"com.google.android.play.games\",\n            \"url\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.google.android.play.games\",\n            \"playstoreUrl\": \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.play.games&hl=en&gl=us\",\n            \"permissions\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.google.android.play.games/permissions\",\n            \"similar\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.google.android.play.games/similar\",\n            \"datasafety\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/apps/com.google.android.play.games/datasafety\",\n            \"categories\": \"https://gplayapi.cashlessconsumer.in/api/categories/\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Google News - Daily Headlines\",\n            \"description\": \"Google News is a personalized news aggregator that organizes and highlights what’s happening in the world so you can discover more about the stories that matter to you.\\n\\nWith Google News, you’ll find:\\n\\nYOUR BRIEFING: It can be nearly impossible to keep up with every story you care about, Your Briefing makes it easy to stay in the know about what’s important and relevant in your world.

I've had this issue access to devices and seeing the other reviewers, I'm not alone in the problem. Something as simple as a 20 minute timer won't go off reliably. There aren't any \\\"missed alarm\\\" notifications for when the alarms don't ring. Nothing but disappointment. This still has not been fixed 6 mos later\",\n                \"For whatever reason the newest update made some BAD changes. I no longer have an easy access when the alarm goes off.

I am unable to cancel it as it doesn't show up when I open up the app. There are no alarms set for those times. There have never been alarms set for those times.

It is only possible when you translate a single word..but not a sentence. Also, if I translate into one language, and then simply want to change it into a different language, I'm not able to do so.

You always know when it's about to happen, because the app starts to become jittery. By that point, it's too late to avoid. There's the screen rotation bug, where it just suddenly stops working automatically. There's the off-screen fullscreen bug. Just, unstable, for an entire year.\",\n                \"Okay, so this app is extremely useful and fun to use, however, it is slowly crumblint over time, specifically as it applies to usage of ads. It has now been updated to force you to watch the two ads at the beginning or even in the middle of videos in order to proceed, and yes you can skip them, but there are some 10-15 second ads that cant be skipped, which means, whilst im attempting to enjoy a video, i have to have upwards of 30 seconds of my time wasted, good app, poor decision making.\",\n                \"Youtube has been running good till i recently updated it. My video would constantly stop and the audio and time would continue playing. I would often find myself skipping backwards in the video just to see if it'll keep going and its an annoying process. I just want to enjoy my videos without having to check on if its playing right. I wouldnt mind it as much if i was listening to music or a podcast, but I really dont do that often. I'm leaving this review in hopes that it gets fixed soon\",\n                \"Completely Miserable To Use. Simply scrolling autoplays everything even remotely visible on screen. Worse of all is that the last second or so of every single video is cut off, when I know for a fact that the videos are longer. It ruins so many videos, especially short ones. I've sat through 30 seconds of ads just for a 3 second video, only for it to cut off the last second. Google really wet the bed in excitement as it clammered for more piles of Ad money, at the expense of the userbase. Awful.\",\n                \"No longer rotates in landscape without unlocking rotation lock. As of v17.33.42 (8/24/22), YouTube stopped allowing landscape videos to rotate if you want the bottom of the screen to be the side other than the one YT chooses. I prefer the top of my device to be the left side when I watch videos b/c it puts the volume controls on the top. I also prefer to leave rotation lock on for my phone since I don't use any other apps in landscape modes.

All of Google's productivity apps are designed to put usability first. There's nothing fancy about Slides; it's just a simple, clean app with all the features you need and everything right where you'd expect it. I appreciate the Google Drive cloud integration too. Being able to access my work from any phone or computer in the world is awesome. Oddly enough; I mostly use Slides as a photo editor for social media. It's surprisingly good at that; lots of customization options.\",\n                \"I was using this for a project and all the things I was using on the computer for it are not available.

Cannot search for images, and images do not show size like it does on computer, which makes it difficult to select the size you need. Text boxes and size of text are difficult to change and adjust. Highlighting is out of the question. Good for presenting but not much else.\",\n                \"Always my go to for making a presentation for school and work.

format, really the only thing going for it that makes it different from other free messaging apps is that it's created by Google. However, when compared to what it's trying to replace, Google Hangouts, it's awful. The format is way worse, the notifications don't give you image previews anymore, and it's overall harder to navigate and use. Will probably switch to a different messaging app, as I only used this hoping it would be similar to Hangouts.\",\n                \"I hate that the default messaging app changes every 9 months. I hate that every new messaging app is worse than the last. I hate that this one is the culmination of only the worst parts of the last 4 messaging apps. You can only attach one picture at a time. You can't open links externally by default. You can't scroll through prior sent pictures. There are no redeeming qualities. I only use it because I'm forced to.\",\n                \"After using this app for many years it was time to part ways with it.

Go ahead and pass that along\",\n                \"Okay, I don't mind the rooms vs single chats. That's fine. It would be nice to be able to choose as an option to group all chats together or see group chat separately from individual chat.

I love the layout and the many options to adjust your images exactly how you want them! The best feature by far is the ability to undo, tweak, or even completely change. It is very easy to customize and make your work as best as possible. I love Snapseed!\",\n                \"Overall this has seemed to be the best alternative to photoshop I've been able to find.

The \\\"Brush\\\" tool would be even better with a size meter/option to control, along with some of the options under \\\"Tune\\\" to be available in the \\\"Brush\\\" tool in order to get them more precise. Maybe an undo button instead of eraser. And some sort of overall tool for smoothing/dehazing/color noise as well.\",\n                \"Great app! Bit of a learning curve so -1☆, but nothing too complicated, and there are tutorials I haven't dug into yet. Love that there are ZERO ads! That's awesome, thank you! Tons of tools! What I really love that other apps don't have, is the ability to go back into each edit and do some major fine tuning or artistic touches, save them as filters, and batch edit a whole collection! A favorite tool is \\\"Expand\\\" I have tried countless apps, and this is the only one with the feature,so TY!\",\n                \"One of the best picture editing apps. 🔥 🔥 🔥 However, please bring back the previous smart/black/white expansion function - it used to be able to expand in only ONE SELECTED DIRECTION (or two) and now expands towards all sides equally which makes editing quite cumbersome later as cropping the unneeded areas isn't very easy to do on a small screen accurately. It used to be so good for framing the picture (black/white expansion) or adding missing areas with the smart expansion tool.\",\n                \"Its ok with very basic editing features. Unfortunately most are unusable aside from the healing brush. Things like dodge and burn should have the ability to adjust intensity on a sliding scale. A standard paintbrush would also be nice if ability to tap an area to adjust color were present. There should also be a selective erase feature for all filters as well as ability to adjust intensity.

Before the latest update, it was a bit more aesthetic and did not obstruct the screen as much when you brought up the seek bar since it was semi-transparent. However, when you bring up the seek bar now, it has this terrible opaque black backing that obstructs about two fifths (2/5) of the video. ---- My theory is that this was done for performance reasons as I notice when you pause, there's no more animation for the pause like there was before (though the symbols are misaligned when you pause). I can understand not doing animations for the sake of speeding the app up, but why remove the transparency? When a user brings up the seek bar, it is not like they're totally disinterested in the video. Being able to see bits of the video underneath is helpful.\",\n                \"We're being forced to use this app for music playing. What a joke. There are no features in this app for playing music that work with the way most people play music. Music and Youtube videos are entirely different things. I don't want a liked song to be replaced by a 10 year old music video that has awful audio. I also don't want a video I liked that featured audio to be part of my music collection. Do people who listen to music actually work on this app? Google is really going downhill with these latest changes. And of course, being google, in a year or two they'll go a completely different direction because they can't get their act together. I'm guessing in 2021 they'll introduce Google Hangouts Music and the only way we can listen to music is if our friends like it too.\",\n                \"When I bought my TV, everything worked great.

I have to go the the app in settings and close it, then reopen it. It also flashes a black screen periodically for a fraction of a second.

Going into the app and removing all updates back to factory delivered version of the app and it works just fine, well until it gets re-updated. This is true on multiple devices from multiple manufactures using multiple different processors.   Very frustrating that Google can't get it together to run their own app on their own platform. It's really pretty inexcusable, especially since Amazon can manage to deliver a more consistent YouTube experience on a FireTV using Silk (or Firefox for that matter) than Google can with their own app on their own platform. Trying to reproduce the same scenario using Chrome on AndroidTV gets you an unnavigatable mess.What ever was done in some update somewhere made this a useless app on many devices.

Just make it it's own Card. Settings > Clock Face > Media Controller > Notifications. I should be able to swipe up and down and get back to it easily. Maybe give an option to make it the default card if media is playing?  3) Battery life still leaves a lot to be desired.  4) Performance still needs a lot of work.\",\n                \"Works great but it could be more useful to add a feature that the clock notifies when the Bluetooth is out-of-range just like some wireless headsets do.

Very useful when you don&#39;t have a botanist on hand! Pl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it. <br><br>Pl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads or cacti. Pl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature of course but also those that grow on the sidewalks of our cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!<br><br>The more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. Flowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant (or the tree if it is one!) is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.  <br><br>At present Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. Don&#39;t be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.<br><br>The new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:<br>- The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.<br>- The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).<br>- The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application. <br>- The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.<br>- The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.<br>- The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.<br>- The mapping of your observations.<br>- Links to many factsheets.<br><br>The web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/\",\n            \"scoreText\": \"4.4\",\n            \"score\": 4.3781066,\n            \"playstoreUrl\": \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.plantnet\",\n            \"permissions\": \"http://gplayapidev.fly.dev/api/apps/org.plantnet/permissions\",\n            \"similar\": \"http://gplayapidev.fly.dev/api/apps/org.plantnet/similar\",\n            \"reviews\": \"http://gplayapidev.fly.dev/api/apps/org.plantnet/reviews\",\n            \"datasafety\": \"http://gplayapidev.fly.dev/api/apps/org.plantnet/datasafety\",\n            \"categories\": \"http://gplayapidev.fly.dev/api/categories/\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Star Roam Sky Map Planet\",\n            \"appId\": \"com.fantasy.star.inour.sky\",\n            \"url\": \"http://gplayapidev.fly.dev/api/apps/com.fantasy.star.inour.sky\",\n            \"icon\": \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aFhedwX3Jx2yr__iatoHtV59PtjAVBhaK8osVbsYlvBkiIZkdkZDVRcuWUwaICN__g\",\n            \"developer\": {\n                \"devId\": \"Findout World Inc\",\n                \"url\": \"http://gplayapidev.fly.dev/api/developers/Findout%20World%20Inc\"\n            },\n            \"currency\": \"USD\",\n            \"price\": 0,\n            \"free\": true,\n            \"summary\": \"In Star Roam, you don&#39;t have to be an astronomer to view the stars overhead.<br><br>Outside or on the balcony, evenings with family and friends are no longer boring.

Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor, add their own voices and sounds, even insert photos of themselves -- then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life.<br><br>ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language (http://scratch.mit.edu), used by millions of young people (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr, we redesigned the interface and programming language to make them developmentally appropriate for younger children, carefully designing features to match young children&#39;s cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.<br><br>We see coding (or computer programming) as a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas, the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for most people. But we think coding should be for everyone, just like writing.<br><br>As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, not just to interact with it. In the process, children learn to solve problems and design projects, and they develop sequencing skills that are foundational for later academic success. They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context, supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr, children aren&#39;t just learning to code, they are coding to learn.<br><br>ScratchJr is a collaboration between the Developmental Technologies group at Tufts University, the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab, and the Playful Invention Company.
